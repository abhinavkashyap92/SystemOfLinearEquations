<h1>System of linear equations</h1>

<hr>
<p>
	This is done as a part of mini project in algorithm course <br>
	The aim of this project is to solve a set of linear equations with many unknowns. <br>
	The algorithms used to solve the system of linear equations are <br>
	<ul>
		<li><i><b>'Guassion elimination method'</b></i></li>
		<li><i><b>'Guassion Siedel method'</b></i></li>
	</ul>
	This project also includes finding inverse of the matrix using <b><i>LDU decomposition</i></b>. <br>
